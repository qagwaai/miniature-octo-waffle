Date: 2026-05-24
Companion to: docs/planning/stellar-brainstorming-findings-2026-05-24.md
Scope: Horizon 1 first, with explicit Horizon 2 motivation tracking

## How to Read This Matrix

Scoring scale:
- Impact: 1 (low) to 5 (high)
- Effort: 1 (small) to 5 (large)
- Risk: 1 (low) to 5 (high)
- Dependency complexity: 1 (few dependencies) to 5 (many dependencies)
- North-star fit: 1 (weak) to 5 (strong)

Weighted priority score:
Priority Score = (Impact x 0.35) + (North-star fit x 0.30) + ((6 - Effort) x 0.15) + ((6 - Risk) x 0.10) + ((6 - Dependency complexity) x 0.10)

Interpretation:
- 4.2 to 5.0: Execute now (strong candidate)
- 3.5 to 4.1: Execute soon (good candidate)
- 2.8 to 3.4: Keep in backlog with dependency notes
- Below 2.8: Re-scope before planning

## Ranked Small-Win Order

Revised canonical ranking (descending by score):
1. ~~SW-R01 Regression Fix: Cold Boot Dart Launch Availability (4.65, Completed 2026-05-25)~~
2. ~~SW-R02 Regression Fix: Missing Starter Ship Inventory Components (4.65, Completed 2026-05-25)~~

21. SW-15 Minimal Character Bust Builder v0 (3.60)
22. SW-13B High-Poly Support for External Object Presentation (3.60)

Tie-break rule used for equal scores: prefer lower risk and fewer dependencies for H1.

Correlation contract override rule:
- Any socket event pair missing correlationId echo is a foundation-layer vulnerability. SW-COR must execute before any new socket event pair is merged.

Regression override rule:
- Any opening-loop regression that blocks expected first-action gameplay (for example initial Dart launch availability) should execute before same-scope net-new work.
- Any regression that removes canonical starter inventory components should execute before same-scope net-new work.
- Any regression that removes a previously available fire/launch action for canonical starter equipment should execute before same-scope net-new work.

Computer progression policy note:
- SW-17 is planned as top-5 among active net-new features.
- Per-ship installation is mandatory; higher computer tiers unlock through combined Computer Systems Installation skill rank and character level gating.
- Automation remains light-assist only with player confirmation for any action execution.

## SW-17 Planning Artifacts (2026-05-30)

1. [SW-17 Computer Progression Implementation Plan](sw-17/sw-17-computer-progression-implementation-plan.md)
2. [SW-17 Computer Progression Closure Checklist](sw-17/sw-17-computer-progression-closure-checklist.md)

## SW-13 Planning Artifacts (2026-05-30)

1. [SW-13 External Object Presentation Expansion Implementation Plan](sw-13/sw-13-external-object-presentation-implementation-plan.md)
2. [SW-13A Ship-External-View Support Implementation Plan](sw-13a/sw-13a-ship-external-view-support-implementation-plan.md)
3. [SW-13B High-Poly Support Implementation Plan](sw-13b/sw-13b-high-poly-support-implementation-plan.md)

SW-13 closure update (2026-05-31):
- SW-13 is closed as Stellar Viewer-only rendering and contract scope.
- ship-external-view support has been split into SW-13A.
- High-poly support across Stellar Viewer and ship-external-view has been split into SW-13B.

SW-13 execution order (Orion coordination baseline):
1. Forge-first: lock descriptor contract, enums, and validation semantics.
2. Nova-next: implement renderer and readability behavior against locked descriptors.
3. Forge then Nova integration pass: wire real payload production, then complete frontend cutover.
4. Joint hardening: contract, component, route-smoke, and performance fallback verification before merge.

## Active Top-5 Net-New Features (Post SW-01 Closure)

1. SW-16 Ship-External Target Persistence on Re-Entry (4.30)
2. SW-02 Market Opportunity Pings (4.25)
3. SW-17 Computer Progression (Per-Ship Intelligence Tiers) (4.20)
4. SW-03 Quick Dock to Trade Flow (4.15)
5. SW-05 Ship Condition Badges in Hangar (4.05)

## Closure Update (2026-05-25)

- SW-R01 closed: Cold boot launch availability restored for Expendable Dart Drone.
- SW-R02 closed: Starter ship inventory restored with Expendable Dart Drone, Sensor Array, and Tractor Beam.
- Both items remain in the matrix as completed historical reliability work.

## SW-08 Post-Implementation Review (2026-05-25)

Effort re-rating:
- Original estimate for SW-08: 2 (small)
- Retrospective rating for delivered scope: 4 (medium-high)

Why the realized effort was higher:
- Scope expansion from shape validation to communication semantics: SW-COR correlation guarantees were required to make drift detection reliable under concurrency.
- Cross-repo coordination overhead: Nova and Forge changes were both required across contracts, handlers, listeners, tests, and documentation.
- Hidden routing defects surfaced under stricter checks: foreign-operation-on-channel issues required additional backend channel-operation hardening.
- Reliability regressions consumed planned capacity: SW-R01, SW-R02, and SW-R03 required opening-loop remediation in parallel with gate work.

What still rates as effort 2:
- A narrow SW-08 implementation that only adds baseline shape checks without semantics enforcement, recurrence controls, or cross-channel routing hardening.

Estimation guardrails going forward:
- If contract work touches both producer and consumer semantics, baseline effort should start at 3.
- If strict correlation/routing assertions are added, baseline effort should start at 4.
- If opening-loop regressions are already active in adjacent surfaces, add +1 contingency tier to schedule/risk planning.

## New Regression Intake (2026-05-25)

- SW-R03 opened: Expendable Dart Drone visible in ship inventory, but fire action from Scavenger's inventory is unavailable.
- Expected behavior: if Expendable Dart Drone exists in Scavenger's inventory, fire action must be available from ship inventory flow.
- Validation target: add launch-action tests covering inventory visibility + action availability parity.

## Recommended Top 3 for Next Sprint (Post-Closure)

1. SW-R03 Regression Fix: Expendable Dart Drone Fire Action from Scavenger Inventory
- Why now: Opening-loop regression reappeared in action semantics; player can see inventory item but cannot perform previously available fire behavior.
- Success signal: Expendable Dart Drone can be fired from Scavenger's inventory when present.
- Validation path: inventory-visibility and fire-action parity tests from ship inventory flow.

2. SW-16 Ship-External Target Persistence on Re-Entry
- Why now: Reliability/continuity issue remains open and directly affects player orientation.
- Success signal: target persists across ship-external view re-entry when still valid.
- Validation path: exit/re-entry target persistence tests with invalid-target fallback checks.

3. SW-01 Mission Board Status Lanes
- Why now: High-value clarity improvement with low implementation risk.
- Success signal: available/active/completed mission separation is visible and filterable.
- Validation path: mission board UX tests and route-level smoke coverage.

Recently closed reliability items:
- SW-R01 Cold Boot Dart Launch Availability (closed 2026-05-25).
- SW-R02 Missing Starter Ship Inventory Components (closed 2026-05-25).

Open regression intake:
- SW-R03 Expendable Dart Drone fire action unavailable from Scavenger's inventory (opened 2026-05-25).

## Alternate Top 3 (If Economy Excitement Is Preferred)

1. SW-R03 Regression Fix: Expendable Dart Drone Fire Action from Scavenger Inventory
2. SW-02 Market Opportunity Pings
3. SW-08 Contract Safety Gate in CI

Reason: better visible momentum in economy systems while preserving one hardening item.

| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| BB-01 | Mission scripting framework | H2/H3 | 5 | 5 | 4 | 5 | 5 | 3.55 | Requires mission DSL, state transitions, authoring tooling |
| BB-02 | Jump-gate route UX and planning | H2 | 5 | 4 | 4 | 4 | 5 | 3.80 | Needs backend route contracts and client visualization layer |

## Big Bet Sequencing Recommendation

1. BB-02 Jump-gate route UX and planning
2. BB-03 Persistent fabrication jobs + async summaries
3. BB-01 Mission scripting framework
4. BB-05 Hotspot decomposition (continuous parallel track)
5. BB-04 NPC-driven market dynamics
6. BB-06 Autonomous NPC hierarchy (pirates to kingpins)
7. BB-07 Skill Mastery Economy and Tech-Tree Coupling
8. BB-08 Asymmetric Combat and Piracy Pressure System
9. BB-09 External Scene Identity and Landmark System
10. BB-10 In-System Short-Hop Travel Network
11. BB-11 Character Identity and Communication Bust Pipeline
12. BB-12 Dynamic Faction Ecology and Consequence Memory
13. BB-13 Run Specialization and Legacy Progression Layer

Reasoning:
- BB-02 and BB-03 produce visible gameplay depth with manageable risk compared to full mission scripting.
- BB-01 should start after route and persistence contracts are stable enough to avoid rework.
- BB-05 should run continuously in narrow slices to reduce architecture risk accumulation.
- BB-05 should explicitly revisit ship-external-view and stellar-viewer on a recurring cadence because both are hot points.
- BB-04 should start only after telemetry and balancing controls improve.
- BB-06 should begin with a narrow runtime scaffold (single-ship pirates) before fleet-level behavior.
- BB-07 should start with one proven skill track (Mining) before introducing multi-skill compound gates.
- BB-08 should begin with a narrow piracy encounter model before adding ship-to-ship escalation paths.
- BB-09 should start with debris and landmark families before full ship/station visual taxonomy.
- BB-10 should start with a single low-tier short-hop drive before adding broader system transit options.
- BB-11 should start with preset-driven busts and deterministic asset constraints before deeper customization.
- BB-12 should begin with a small faction set and explicit consequence telemetry before large simulation breadth.
- BB-13 should begin with one specialization branch and one constrained legacy unlock band.

## Technology Tree and Skills Addendum (New)

Scope statement:
- Provide a visible technology progress tree with explicit item-gating criteria and a character-skill system that advances through activity usage.

Initial gating example:
1. Mining Drill Tier 2 unlock requires Mining level threshold + materials + prior tier completion.

2. Mining Drill Tier 3 unlock requires higher Mining level + rare materials + hazard-zone progression requirement.

Seed skill catalog for planning:
1. Mining
2. Salvage
3. Fabrication
4. Repair and Retrofit
5. Piloting
6. Navigation and Astrogation
7. Scanning and Surveying
8. Negotiation
9. Trading and Logistics
10. Drone Operations
11. Security and Defense
12. Command and Fleet Coordination

Validation expectations:
- Unit tests for skill XP accumulation and level threshold checks.
- Contract tests for unlock-state payloads and tree-node gate reasons.
- Integration tests ensuring progression remains achievable and non-stalling for early tiers.

## NPC Simulation Breakdown (New)

Scope statement:
- NPCs run continuously in backend simulation, from single-ship pirates in asteroid belts to kingpins controlling fleets.

Phased implementation slices:
1. Slice A: Runtime scaffold (H1/H2 bridge)
- Tick scheduler, actor state model, and deterministic seed controls.
- One archetype: Belt Pirate with local patrol/intercept behavior.

2. Slice B: Coordinated groups (H2)
- Raider Cell behavior with shared target selection and route pressure events.

3. Slice C: Fleet command (H2/H3)
- Kingpin doctrine with regional influence and economic disruption hooks.

Validation expectations:
- Unit tests for actor state transitions and deterministic tick replay.
- Contract tests for NPC event payloads consumed by frontend.
- Integration tests to verify NPC activity does not break market/mission invariants.

## Combat and Piracy Addendum (New)

Scope statement:
- Ship-to-ship combat stays intentionally minimal at first, centered on piracy, cargo theft, escape, and sacrificial drones.

Core constraints:
1. Minimal shields only; they should soften danger, not erase it.
2. Pirates may steal cargo without killing the pilot.
3. Dart drone impact against pirates should usually end in drone loss and parts-level salvage.
4. The encounter model should communicate that space is hard and unforgiving.

Validation expectations:
- Unit tests for theft, escape, damage, and drone-destruction outcomes.
- Contract tests for encounter summary payloads and loss reporting.
- Integration tests ensuring combat resolution does not corrupt cargo/ship state.

## External Objects and Travel Addendum (New)

Scope statement:
- Improve ship-external view so debris, ships, jump gates, and stations have clearer identity, and add a low-tier short-hop drive so in-system travel remains practical.

Core constraints:
1. Debris should render as detailed enough meshes to communicate item identity and salvage value.
2. Ships and stations should use recognizable visual families.
3. Jump gates should be unmistakable navigational landmarks.
4. Short-hop travel must preserve fuel cost and route choice.

Validation expectations:
- Unit tests for drive cost and route eligibility.
- Contract tests for external object descriptors and identity fields.
- Integration tests for travel action outcomes and scene object selection.

## Character Bust Builder Addendum (New)

Scope statement:
- Build a minimal browser-based character builder focused on bust-level face identity, with reuse for NPCs and ship-to-ship communication views.

Core constraints:
1. Treat as a separate high-3D-budget implementation track.
2. Limit v0 to bust-level controls: face variants, skin tones, tattoos, scars.
3. Preserve runtime performance and avoid degrading existing scene responsiveness.
4. Save/load format should be deterministic and reusable by NPC generation.

Validation expectations:
- Unit tests for serialization/deserialization of bust customization state.
- Contract tests for identity payload fields used by player/NPC views.
- Integration tests for rendering busts in communication contexts.

## Replayability Roundout Addendum (New)

Scope statement:
- Improve long-term replayability through (a) dynamic faction ecology with persistent world consequences and (b) per-run specialization paired with constrained campaign-level legacy progression.

Core constraints:
1. Faction outcomes must be visible and interpretable in missions, routes, and markets.
2. Legacy progression should expand options, not collapse challenge.
3. Specialization choices should materially differentiate runs.
4. Replayability systems must avoid power creep that invalidates early/mid-game loops.

Validation expectations:
- Simulation tests for faction state transitions and territorial/economic deltas.
- Contract tests for consequence summary payloads and legacy progression state.
- Integration tests confirming that distinct builds produce distinct viable play patterns.

Recurring decomposition reminder:
- ship-external-view and stellar-viewer should be reviewed periodically even when they are not the primary focus of a sprint, because they remain structural hot points.

## Dependency and Guardrail Checklist (Use During Sprint Planning)

Before committing a feature to sprint:
- Confirm at least 3 out of 5 north-star decision filter answers are yes.
- Define one user-visible success signal.
- Define one test or contract validation path.
- Confirm no new tight coupling to known hotspots.
- Record at least one rollback or fallback plan for release safety.

## Suggested Planning Cadence

Week 1:
- Implement SW-08 + test fixtures.
- Start SW-01 core UI and tests.

Week 2:
- Complete SW-01 and SW-03.
- Add telemetry hooks to prepare BB-02/BB-03 prioritization for next cycle.
